<ol>
	<li>
	Write a simulator of an M/M/1 queue. Your simulator should follow the 
  general structure described in the lecture notes. Namely, the simulator will consist of 
  two parts: (1) a controller, which is the same exact logic for all simulators 
  you will be writing for the course, and (2) a simulated system, which will be 
  different for each system you simulate. 
  	<p>As discussed in the notes, the two data structures needed for the controller 
  are the current simulated time (initialized to 0) and a &quot;calendar&quot; or 
  &quot;schedule&quot; of events 
  which is a linked list of &quot;future&quot; events, each of which has a timestamp and a 
  pointer to the function that needs to be executed at that time. The simulation 
  controller's logic is very simple:</p>
	<ol type="a">
		<li>Set t=0; and call a function to initialize the simulated world and the 
      calendar</li>
		<li>While t is less than the desired time for the simulation<ol>
			<li>Get the next event from the calendar</li>
			<li>Adjust the current time to be the time of that event, and </li>
			<li>Call the function that needs to be executed to reflect the occurrence 
      of the event</li>
		</ol></li>
		<li>Call a function that prints the results of the simulation, etc.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>For the M/M/1 queue, the simulated &quot;world&quot; would consist of a simple 
  linked list of requests in the queue. The two possible events (for each of 
  which you will need to define a function) are a &quot;birth event&quot; and a &quot;death 
  event&quot;. Notice that in each of these events, you may need to have code that 
  would record important information, e.g., when was service started, completed, 
  etc. In addition to figuring out the logic of these two functions, you will 
  need to figure out how to initialize the simulated system. </p>
	<p>Finally, in addition to the specifics of the M/M/1 system above, it is 
  often desirable to measure a particular phenomenon (or value) every constant 
  amount of time (say every millisecond) and report what is observed (and 
  potentially calculate some statistics, e.g., mean, standard deviation, etc.) 
  As discussed in the notes, a handy way to do this is to define a &quot;special&quot; 
  event, call it the &quot;monitoring 
  event&quot;, which happens periodically (e.g., report some value every millisecond), or even 
	better at random exponentially distributed intervals following the PASTA 
	principle, and which simply 
  reports the state of the simulated world (perhaps by writing some values to a 
  file). </p>
	<p>To test your simulator, use it to verify the following settings for an 
  M/M/1 system: 
	<ol>
		<li type="a">Lambda = 50 and Ts = 0.015 and simulation time = 100</li>
		<li type="a">Lambda = 65 and Ts = 0.015 and simulation time = 100</li>
		<li type="a">Lambda = 65 and Ts = 0.020 and simulation time = 100</li>
	</ol>
	<p>For each of the above calculate Tw, Tq, and w, and q and compare them to 
	whatever analysis is able to tell you. Make sure that you measure the system 
	after it had a chance to &quot;warm up&quot; (i.e., reach steady state). Recall that 
	one way to do this is to run the simulation for twice as long and collect 
	measurement only for the second half of your simulation. </p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p> </li>
	<li>Modify the M/M/1 discrete event simulator that you have developed to simulate an M/M/1/K queue. Clearly, the difference between an 
	M/M/1/K queue and an M/M/1 queue is that upon a &quot;birth event&quot;, one of two 
	things may happen, either the queue is not full (i.e., total number of 
	requests in the system is less than K), in which case the birth event 
	results in the addition of one more customer to the queue (as in the M/M/1 
	queue), or else, the queue is full, in which case the birth event is 
	&quot;rejected&quot;.
	<p>To test your simulator, use it to verify the following settings for an 
  M/M/1/K system<ol>
		<li type="a">K = 5, Lambda = 30, Ts = 0.03 and simulation time = 100 
		</li>
		<li type="a">K = 5, Lambda = 50, Ts = 0.03 and simulation time = 100</li>
	</ol>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0">For each of the above calculate the 
	95th-percentile confidence interval for q, Tq, and the rejection probability 
	and compare them to what you expect from analysis (note: this simulation is 
	for the same setting in problem #3 in <a href="../03">homework assignment #3</a>, 
	which you solved analytically).</p>
	<p>Modify your M/M/1/K simulator so as to 
		simulate an M/D/1/K system -- i.e., a finite queue of size K with 
	Poisson arrivals and a fixed service time. To test your simulator, use it to verify the following settings for an 
  M/G/1/K system: 
	<ol>
		<li type="a" value="3">K = 5, Lambda = 30, service time Ts is fixed and 
		equal to 0.03,&nbsp; and simulation 
		time = 100</li>
		<li type="a">K = 5, Lambda = 50, service time Ts is fixed and equal to 
		0.03,&nbsp; and simulation 
		time = 100</li>
	</ol>
	<p>For each of the above calculate the 95th-percentile confidence interval 
	for q, Tq, and the rejection probability, and compare to the results you 
	obtained in parts (a) and (b). Any conclusions?</p>&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Consider the system described in problem #5 in <a href="../03">homework 
	assignment #3</a>, but with the following 
  assumptions:
  	<ul>
		<li>Process arrivals are Poisson with a rate of 40 processes per second</li>
		<li>CPU service time is uniformly distributed between 10 and 30 msec</li>
		<li>Disk I/O service time is normally distributed with mean of 100 msec and 
    standard deviation of 20 msec (but never negative)</li>
		<li>Network service time is constant with mean of 25 msec</li>
		<li>All buffers are of infinite size</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Write a discrete-event simulator for 
  the system described above. Run your simulator for a period of 100 seconds 
  and answer the following:&nbsp;<ol type="a">
		<li>Plot the number of requests waiting in the CPU queue as a function of 
  time.<br>Note: Obtain a measurement every (simulated) second and plot your 
		measurement as a function of time (i.e. from time 0 to time 100) using 
		spreadsheet software such as Excel.</li>
		<li>Determine a point in the simulation after which you feel confident that 
  the system has reached a steady state.</li>
		<li>Compute the 95th and 98th percentile confidence interval for the:
        <ul type="disc">
			<li>Number of requests in the CPU queue at steady state</li>
			<li>Response time through the system at steady state</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>How do the results you obtain from this simulation compare to those you got 
  analytically in problem #5&nbsp; in <a href="../03">homework assignment #3</a>? Comment on whether any similarity or 
  differences makes sense. </li>
	</ol>&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Consider the same system used for the above problem with one modification:
  	<ul>
		<li>The network interface card can only hold <i>k </i>requests.</li>
		<li>Any request for network I/O that cannot be queued will simply exit the 
    system and are declared &quot;failed&quot;.&nbsp; </li>
	</ul>
	<p>Modify your simulator to allow for this modification. Answer the 
  following:&nbsp;<ol type="a">
		<li>Plot the percentage of failed requests that end-up exiting the system 
    for various values of k (e.g., k=1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, and 20). Note: Run your simulator for a period of 100 seconds for each value of k 
    and plot the results.</li>
		<li>You are asked to provide an estimate for the capacity of the system 
		-- which is the offered load at which the system starts to &quot;buckle&quot;. The 
		system buckles if any of its queues grows continuously. Using your 
		simulator, identify the process arrival rate that make the system 
		buckle. What resource is the culprit?</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
