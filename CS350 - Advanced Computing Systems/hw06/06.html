	</ol>&nbsp;</li>
	<li>A web server has a caching subsystem that holds a set of files out of 
	all the files in the system. Each file in the file system has a unique ID 
	(e.g., filename). Requests served from the cache take much less time than 
	those served from the disk. Thus, in an attempt to speed up its operation, 
	the web server uses the following scheduler for HTTP requests:
	<ol type="i">
		<li>When a request for a file fi is received, if fi is in the cache, 
		then the request is put in Q1, otherwise it is put in Q2. </li>
		<li>When the server is available to process a request: If Q1 is not 
		empty, then the server picks the next request from Q1, otherwise the 
		server picks a request fj from Q2, where fj is the smallest ID of all 
		requests larger than the maximum ID of any file in the cache.</li>
		<li>When a file fj is retrieved from disk (in response to a request 
		de-queued from Q2), then fj is cached by replacing the file fk with the 
		minimum ID amongst all files in the cache.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Answer the following questions:
	<ol type="a">
		<li>Show that starvation is possible in the above system… Specifically, 
		describe a particular scenario under which starvation is possible.
		<p>To minimize the impact of starvation, a friend of yours suggested 
		that the following initial step be incorporated at the beginning of the 
		above solution: </p>
		<blockquote>
			<p><i>Requests to the web server are batched up in groups of up to N 
			requests. A batch is processed by going through steps (i), (ii) and 
			(iii) for all requests in the batch. Once all requests in a batch 
			are processed, a new batch is considered, etc. </i></p>
		</blockquote></li>
		<li>What kind of disk scheduling algorithm was your friend thinking of 
		when he suggested the above fix? </li>
		<li>Discuss the effect of N on the effectiveness of the cache (i.e., is 
		a large N better for improving the cache performance or is a small N 
		better?)</li>
		<li>Discuss the effect of N on the fairness of the above system (i.e., 
		is a large N better for improving fairness or is a small N better for 
		fairness?)</li>
	</ol>
	<p>&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Requests for disk I/O arrive according to a Poisson process with rate 
	Lambda (requests per second). Each request&nbsp; for disk access targets a 
	specific track. Requests for tracks are uniformly distributed over the set 
	of N tracks in the disk. The service time <i>Ts&nbsp; </i>for a request to track
	<i>x</i> is given by:
	<p>&nbsp;<i>Ts = U + V * | y - x |</i></p>
	<p>where y is the location of the disk head prior to serving the request, 
	and where <i>U </i>and <i>V</i> are constants.</p>
	<p>You are to write a simulator to compare the performance of the RANDOM, 
	FCFS and SCAN disk schedulers when used to manage the above disk. Your simulator should 
	evaluate the performance of all three schedulers when subjected to a workload of 
	10,000 requests.
	<p>Hint: Think about what constitutes the state of the disk. Also, for each 
	request in the queue you should specify a track number from [1,N] (generated 
	uniformly at random). Now, upon a death event, if the queue is not empty, 
	the scheduler would select one of the requests according to what the 
	scheduling algorithm implies.<p>For each scheduler, you need to calculate the following:
	<ul>
		<li>The total head movement </li>
		<li>The average response time </li>
		<li>The 95th percentile of the response time </li>
	</ul>
	<p>Use the following parameters:
	<ul>
		<li>Lambda = 50 requests per second </li>
		<li>N = 500 tracks </li>
		<li>U = 2 msec </li>
		<li>V = 0.1 msec/track </li>
	</ul>
	<p>What did you expect the results to show? Did they match your 
	expectations? 
	</li>
