<ol>
	<li>
	Read this <a href="../../handouts/JavaConcurrency.html">short primer</a> 
	about multithreading in Java. Using multithreading you are able to have 
	multiple threads (for our purposes, we can also think of them as processes 
	as well).<p>&nbsp;<ol type="a">
	<li>Write a Java program that will spawn and run concurrently two threads of 
	the same code. The code that each&nbsp; thread will follow should consist of 
	a loop that executes five times. Each iteration of the loop should start by 
	having the thread print the first of the five lines below (using a &quot;print&quot; 
	statement), then sleep for some random amount of time (say between 0 and 20 
	msec), then print the second line, then sleep again, etc. until all five 
	lines below are printed out.<blockquote>
		<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&quot;Thread i is starting 
		iteration k&quot;</p>
		<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&quot;We hold these truths to be 
		self-evident, that all men are created equal,&quot;</p>
		<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&quot;that they are endowed by 
		their Creator with certain unalienable Rights,&quot;</p>
		<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&quot;that among these are Life, 
		Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.&quot;</p>
		<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&quot;Thread i is done with 
		iteration k&quot;</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Run your code and show that the 
	output of the two processes will be interleaved (making the output 
	incomprehensible). </p>
	<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</li>
	<li>To make the above work, you will need to use a critical section so that 
	the five print statements in a single iteration are all inside that critical 
	section. Use the following version of the Dekker's algorithm and show that 
	the statements are printed cohesively.<p><u><i>CS Entry Protocol for 
	Procedss i</i></u><br>
	<font face="Courier New">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; flag[i]:=true; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; while flag[j]{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (turn==j) { <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; flag[i]:=false;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; while (flag[j]==true) {};<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; flag[i]:=true;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>
&nbsp; </font></p>
	<p><u><i>CS Exit Protocol for Process i</i></u><br>
	<font face="Courier New">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; turn:=j;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; flag[i]:=false;</font></p>
	<p>&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Can you illustrate (using your code) that using the above Dekker 
	algorithm, it is possible for (say) thread 0 to be executing its entry 
	protocol while thread 1 manages to get into the critical section more than 
	once.Hint: You may want to use artificial delay (e.g., sleep) instructions 
	that will make the threads proceed at different speeds.<p>&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Replace the above Dekker algorithm with the following Peterson algorithm 
	and show that the scenario you created in (c) does not occur.<p><u><i>CS 
	Entry Protocol for Process i</i></u><br><font face="Courier New">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	turn:=j; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; flag[i]:=true;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; while (flag[j] 
	&amp;&amp; turn==j) {};</font></p>
	<p><u><i>CS Exit Protocol for Process i</i></u><br><font face="Courier New">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; flag[i]:=false</font>;</li>
</ol>
	<p>&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Consider the Bakery algorithm discussed in class and in the notes. One 
	idea was to use a ticket = 1 to avoid having to use the 
	&quot;choosing&quot; flag. Making such a change would give us the code below.<br>
	Note: Assume that the variable ticket can be arbitrarily large (i.e., you do 
	not have to worry about it becoming too big).
	<p><i><u>CS Entry Protocol for Process i</u></i><br>
	<font face="Courier New">&nbsp; ticket[i]:=1; <br>&nbsp; ticket[i]:=max(ticket[0]..ticket[n-1])+1;<br>&nbsp; for j:=0 to n-1 do {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; while(ticket[j]!=0 &amp;&amp; (ticket[j],j)&lt;(ticket[i],i)){};<br>&nbsp; }</font></p>
	<p><i><u>CS ExitProtocol for Process i</u></i><br><font face="Courier New">&nbsp; ticket[i]:=0;</font></p>
	<ol type="a">
		<li>Does the above tweak work? If yes, then prove it, if not, then provide a 
	counter example.</li>
		<li>Implement the above version of the Bakery algorithm in Java, and 
		dependent on your answer to part (a) either show a set of (say 4) 
		threads reciting the declaration of independence cohesively, or else 
		not.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>&nbsp;</p></li>
	<li>As discussed in class, all software approaches for mutual exclusion rely 
	on &quot;busy waiting&quot;.&nbsp; In this problem, we will &quot;measure&quot; the overhead 
	from this busy waiting. We will do so simply by counting the number of times 
	a busy waiting loop is executed in your solution of problem (1.d). You can 
	do so by having each thread keep a count of how many times it executed the 
	&quot;while&quot; loop. What results do you obtain? e.g., on average, how many times 
	is the busy-waiting loop executed per request for the critical section? You 
	may want to repeat your experiment a number of times and report a 
	95th-percent confidence interval. 
	<p>Note: By incrementing a counter in the busy-waiting loop, you are 
	effectively undercounting the number of iterations -- i.e., without that 
	counter in the picture, the loop condition would have been checked more 
	times.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
