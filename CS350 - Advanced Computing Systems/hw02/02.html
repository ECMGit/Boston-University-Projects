<ol>
  <li>As we discussed in class, the availability of a system is defined as the 
	probability that the system is &quot;up&quot; (i.e., available) when accessed at some 
	random point in time. A friend of yours working in a startup was tasked with 
	the development of a web service that would be at least 99% available. To 
	measure the availability of the service that he developed, your friend wrote 
	a script which periodically (every minute) &quot;pinged&quot; the service and reported 
	the percentage of all these pings that were successful (i.e., the service 
	was available). His findings were that the service availability was 0.95 
	(i.e., 95%). To salvage his job, your friend suggested that instead of 
	offering the service through a single server, he would set up the service on 
	two identical servers such that if the first server is down, the second 
	server would take over.<ol type="a">
  <li>What is your guess as to the availability of the service when offered 
	using the new 2-server configuration? Show all calculations.&nbsp; </li>
</ol>
	<p>Your friend's supervisor, upon learning of the above results, was quite 
	unhappy. She brought up two concerns -- namely, (1) she did not trust the 
	measurement approach that your friend used to evaluate the availability of 
	the service on a single server, and (2) even if those measurements were 
	correct, she did not believe that running the service on two servers as 
	described above would boost availability as your friend had hoped.
	<ol type="a" start="2">
  <li>Suggest a pattern of server failures that will end-up in an &quot;over 
	estimation&quot; (or an &quot;under estimation&quot;) of the service availability using 
	your friend's measurement approach?</li>
	<li>Suggest a better measurement approach.</li>
	<li>What assumption needs to hold for the two-server configuration suggested 
	by your friend to yield the improvement in availability that your friend had 
	hoped for? </li>
	<li>Suggest a failure scenario that would violate such an 
	assumption? </li>
</ol>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The average time it takes to read a block from disk is 2 msec and
   the standard deviation is 0.8 msec. In order to retrieve a file
   that consists of N blocks, it is necessary to perform n consecutive
   block reads from disk. Let the random variable Tn be the time it takes to 
	retrieve n blocks from the disk, where n is large.
	<ol>
		<li type="a">What is the probability distribution for the random variable Tn? 
	Write down the PDF of Tn, when n=100.</li>
		<li type="a">What is the mean and standard deviation of Tn, when n=100.</li>
		<li type="a">What is the probability that the retrieval
   time for a file that consists of 100 blocks will be between&nbsp; 185 and 190 msec?
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The arrival of packets at an Ethernet adapter of a web server is described by a
   Poisson process with a rate of 100 packets per second. Answer the
   following questions:
  <blockquote>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Write down the formula for the probability distribution of the number 
		of packets arriving to the adapter in one millisecond.</li>
		<li>What is the probability that more than 1 packet will be received 
		within a 10-millisecond period of time?</li>
		<li>Write down the formula for the probability distribution of the
        inter-arrival time of packets.</li>
		<li>What is the probability that two packets will be separated by more 
		than 20 milliseconds?&nbsp;</li>
		<li>What is the standard deviation of the inter-arrival time of packets?</li>
		<li>What is the probability that the time between the arrival of a 
      packet and the arrival of the 100th packet following that frrst packet is 
		less than 1.1 seconds? </li>
    </ol>
  </blockquote>
	</li>
  <li>Packets that arrive to the Ethernet adapter described in the above problem are queued 
	up in a
        buffer until processed by the Interrupt Service Routine
        (ISR). Assuming that the service time per packet is
        exponential with an average of 8 milliseconds.&nbsp;Answer the following 
	questions: 
	<blockquote>
    <ol type="a" start="7">
      <li>What is the capacity of the Ethernet adapter?</li>
		<li>Write down the probability distribution of the number of packets at 
		the Ethernet adapter.</li>
		<li>How many packets
        do you expect to find in the buffer of the adapter at any point in time (on
        average)?</li>
		<li>What is the
        average waiting time in the buffer (i.e. how long is a packet
        buffered until the ISR starts processing it)?&nbsp;</li>
      <li>What is the slowdown caused by queuing at the Ethernet adapter?</li>
		<li>The web server is under a Denial of Service (DoS) attack, causing 
		the system to crash. What is the minimum rate of adversarial traffic 
		that must have been injected to cause the crash? </li>
    </ol>
  </blockquote></li>
	<li>Write a C /C++/Java function -- say Zrand() -- that returns a random value that is 
	distributed according to a standard normal distribution. Write another 
	C/C++/Java -- say Grand() -- that uses Zrand() to generate a random value 
	that is distributed according to a normal distribution with a mean U and 
	standard deviation S, where U and S are the real-valued arguments of 
	Grand(). 
	<p>Hint: Given that all you have through common C/C++/Java libraries is a uniform random number generator 
	-- e.g., drand48() -- you will need to find the relationship 
		that maps a uniform random variable that ranges from 0 to 1 to a 
		standard normal random variable. One way of doing this is to use the 
		Central Limit Theorem (CLT) to generate this random value using the 
		uniform random number generator drand48(). Recall that according to CLT, 
		the sum of N random variables (that follow any distribution with finite 
		moments) approaches a Normal distribution, whose mean is N times the 
		mean of the individual random variables, and whose variance is N times 
		the variance of the individual random variables. </p>
	<p>&nbsp;Note: You may assume that aggregating 30 or more samples is &quot;enough&quot; for the CLT to 
		hold.</p></li>
