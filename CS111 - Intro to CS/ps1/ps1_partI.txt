1a) i. 'abc', ' ' ', and '!!' all cause errors
      ii. The type of error caused is called a Lexical error.

 b) i.(int) 'a' = 97
        (int) 'b' = 98
        (int) 'c' = 99
        (int) 'A' = 65
        (int) 'B' = 66
        (int) 'C' = 67
        (int) '1' = 49
        (int) '2' = 50
        (int) '3' = 51
     	
     ii.  Lowercase letters seem to begin at 97, with each letter following having a value 1 greater than the previous.
          Uppercase letters seem to begin at 65 with each letter following having a value 1 greater than the previous.
         When numbers are stored as a character, their values begin at 49 with each number following having a value 1 greater than the previous.


     iii. (char)75 = 'K'
          (char)87 = 'W'
          (char)100 = 'd'
          (char)('a' + 1) = 'b'
          (char)('a' + 2) = 'c'
          (char)('a' + 3) = 'd'

     iv. (char)('a' + 5)

 c) i. 'a' + 1 = 98
        "a" + 1 = "a1"
        'a' + 2 = 99
        "a" + 2 = "a2"
        'a' + 'b' = 195
        "a" + "b" = "ab"

     ii. When adding two individual characters, the output is the sum of the values of both characters. When adding two strings, or a string and a character, the output is the combination of both strings (not the numerical value).

2) a. 

public class MyProgram {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("This code is problematic!");
        System.out.println("Can you get it to compile?");
    }
}      


b. class is invalid because it is a reserved keyword.
    total value is invalid because it contains a space.
    7dwarfs is invalid because it begins with a number.

c.
        System.out.println("///\\\\\\ \\\\// /\'\\");
        System.out.println("\"Hi\", said Perry.  \"What\'s new?\"");
        System.out.println("\"Not much\", said Libby. \"What\'s new with you?\"");
