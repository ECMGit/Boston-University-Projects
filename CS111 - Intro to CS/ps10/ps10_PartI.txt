2. a. This is a NOT a valid assignment  because Automobile is not a subclass of Limousine. Therefore it can not inherit its properties. An Automobile is not always a Limousine
    b. This is a valid assignment because Automobile is a subclass of Object and inherits its properties. An Automobile is an Object.
    c. This is a valid assignment because TractorTrailer is a subclass of Truck and inherits its properties. A TractorTrailer is a Truck.
