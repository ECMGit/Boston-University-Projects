NeuralNetsHW changelog

---------------------------------------

2/20
	-Weights are now "updated" hopefully
	-Formula for delta was modified, but may or may not be correct.
	-DeltaFlag no longer in use.
	-Bug: Calculation tends towards an extreme rather than the expected value, i.e. actual[0] will go towards 1 whether or not expected is 1.
